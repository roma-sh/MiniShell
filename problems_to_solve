check for seg fault".

$? (I need the status for the exit code).

I can clean and I can check for exit codes.

I need to change the expander to take out env instead of the real one
when I know how the execution works


exit codes : 

echo "Hello, World!"
echo $?  # Output: 0

ls nonexistentfile
echo $?  # Output: 1

exit 256
echo $?  # Output: 2

/bin/ls /root  # Assuming you don't have permissions
echo $?  # Output: 126

nonexistentcommand
echo $?  # Output: 127

kill -9 $$
echo $?  # Output: 137 (This will kill the shell, so you won't see this output)

sleep 10
# Press Control-C during the sleep
echo $?  # Output: 130

exit 300
echo $?  # Output: 255
