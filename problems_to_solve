check for seg fault".


cd, and function for execution.

cd, cd .. cd /Users/eperperi/etc cd ~.

$? (I need the status).

I can clean and I can check for exit codes.

+ at export is to append

export problems
	- += is append

unset problems
	- same variable / grammar check as export, e.g cant start with a 1


echo problem
	- multiple -n flags not removed before work
	- multiple n's not creating -n effects


init.c: line:113 qoutes doesn't return the correct i
I did chnage it from return (i + j + 1) because I don't know if it will affect the others cases
